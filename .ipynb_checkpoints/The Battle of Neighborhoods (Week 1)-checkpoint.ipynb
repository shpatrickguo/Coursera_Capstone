    "The Covid-19 pandemic continues to cause widespread economic distruption leading to the permanent closure of thousands of businesses. An increasing number of people have difficulty procuring food supplies. Restaraunts are trying to remain profitable despite loing a significant amount of business due to stay-in-shelter, no indoor seating, and social distancing amid health and safety concerns. However, some alternative eateries are continuing to operate and doing better than they imagined: food trucks. These services provide meals from motorized vehicles or carts. \n",
    "Food trucks also experience lower sales due to the absence of office workers and large decline of street traffic. Howver unlike restaurants that are fixed facilties, food trucks can quickly change location, menu and market. Operators have adapted by branching out into residential areas to capitalize on the large portion of people staying at home. Sales fluctuate wildly depending on a number of factors, most of which depend on location. This report uses machine learning tools to assist food trucks operators looking for the best locations in San Francisco. The report will cluster San Francisco neighborhoods in order to recommend venues according to amenities and facilities surrounding such venues."
